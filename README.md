# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection & Segmentation with YOLOv8 + SAM

Welcome to the ultimate medical imaging project! This notebook leverages the power of **YOLOv8** (for object detection) and **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** (for segmentation) to identify and segment brain tumors from MRI images. 🚀

---

## 📓 Project Overview

- **Notebook:** `CB_01.ipynb`
- **Goal:** Detect and segment brain tumors in MRI scans using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Tech Stack:**
  - YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
  - Segment Anything Model (SAM)
  - PyTorch, OpenCV, Matplotlib, PIL
  - Kaggle Datasets
- **Demo Video:** <video src="Yolo.mp4" controls width="600" poster="https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUR_THUMBNAIL_ID/0.jpg">

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Tumor Detection:** Fast and accurate localization of tumors in MRI images.
- 🎨 **Precise Segmentation:** SAM refines YOLO's detections for pixel-perfect tumor masks.
- 📦 **Kaggle Integration:** Seamless dataset download and setup.
- 🛠️ **Fully Notebook-Based:** All steps, from setup to results, are in `CB_01.ipynb`.
- 💾 **Easy to Run:** Just follow the cells in order—no code outside the notebook required!

## 🚦 Quickstart

1. **Clone this repo & open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Yolo
   jupyter notebook CB_01.ipynb
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - The notebook will prompt you to install all required packages (Ultralytics, OpenCV, Matplotlib, SAM, Pillow, Kaggle).
   - Or, pre-install with:
     ```bash
     pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib segment-anything pillow kaggle
     ```

3. **Kaggle API setup:**
   - Download your `kaggle.json` from your Kaggle account.
   - Upload it when prompted in the notebook.

4. **Run all cells:**
   - The notebook will guide you through dataset download, model training, and inference.

5. **Watch the magic:**
   - Check out the results and the [Yolo.mp4](./Yolo.mp4) video for a project demo! 🎬

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Setup & Dependencies**  
   📦 Installs all required libraries and downloads the SAM checkpoint.

2. **Dataset Download**  
   📥 Fetches the brain tumor MRI dataset from Kaggle.

3. **YOLOv8 Training**  
   🏋️‍♂️ Fine-tunes YOLOv8 on the brain tumor dataset for detection.

4. **SAM Segmentation**  
   ✂️ Uses SAM to segment tumors within YOLO-detected regions.

5. **Visualization**  
   🖼️ Displays original, detected, and segmented images side by side.

6. **Demo Video**  
   🎥 See [Yolo.mp4](./Yolo.mp4) for a walkthrough!
